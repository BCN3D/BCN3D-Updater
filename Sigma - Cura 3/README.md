## BCN3D Sigma files for Cura 3

Files to load properly the Sigma 3D Printer by BCN3D Technologies to Cura 2.

While we are working on it you can download them here:
 
 * [Cura 3.0](http://goo.gl/BKDE3l)

#### Configuration

##### Mac OS:
 1. **Combine** all folders inside *MacOS* with the ones inside */Applications/Cura.app/Contents/Resources*
 2. Restart Cura 3

##### Windows:
 1. **Combine** all folders inside *Windows* with the ones inside *C:/Program Files/Cura 3.x*
 2. Restart Cura 3

#### FYI

All the profile files are generated by the [Sigma ProGen](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3DSigma-Profile-Generator) tool, go to its GitHub repo to track new changes.

The files are a patch to add the Sigma to the current version of Cura 2. We are developing the BCN3D Cura where all these files will come installed by default. (oh yes!)

By now we keep the files as a google drive link so you can easily  download the bundle directly without downloading the full Utilities repo, or generating the files manually with the ProGen script.

Thanks for testing!
