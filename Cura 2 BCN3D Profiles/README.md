### Configuration

- ``Definitions`` folder contains the **.json** files for the printers and you need to copy the content of the folder to this directory --> ``C:\Program Files\Cura 2.3\resources\definitions``
- ``Models`` folder contains the **.stl** files for the printers and you need to copy the content of the folder to this directory --> ``C:\Program Files\Cura 2.3\resources\meshes``

### Working on your own profiles

If you want to work in generating your own profiles and help us out, here is some basic information.

The log file is your friend. Cura pretty much logs everything it happens in the background so you can read some useful messages when things doesn't work as expected.
The Cura log file is located under: ``C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\cura`` and you'll need to enable hidden files. Or you can go to **help** -> **Show configuration Folder**.

As Ultimaker has not released official information about how their json files work, the process is a little bit trial and error.
